# GitHub Contribution Calendar Clone (WIP)

This calendar clone is made with a React.js frontend and supported by a Ruby on Rails API mode backend to store users and their contributions.

The frontend utilizes JSON Web Tokens to authorize users from the backend. Contributions which are saved to the database will be displayed on the calendar once users are logged in.
